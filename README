Notes
=====

Some environments (like Konsole of KDE3) don't show well the tasks that have
childs. The normal way to show them is because they are bold, but in some 
shells the bold characters are indistinguishable of the normal ones. For that
cases (or others) there is the posibility of show "(+)", for the collapsed 
tasks, and "(-)", for the expanded tasks, at the left of them. This option is
activated on the config file by the option:
visual_tree  = yes
