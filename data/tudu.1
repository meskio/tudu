.SH NAME
TuDu \- A command-line tool to manage TODO lists hierarchically.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP 
\fBtudu \fR[\fB-f \fItudu_file\fR] [\fB-c \fIconfig_file\fR] [\fB-v[v]\fR]
[\fB-h\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTuDu\fR is a commandline tool to manage hierarchical TODO lists, so that you
can organize everything you have to do in a simple and efficient way. 
It does not use any database backend, but plain XML files.

Every TODO is composed by:
.TS
tab (>);
l l.
Status>Currently only two options: Pending and Done.
Title>A short sentence summarizing the task.
Description text>A longer text providing more details. (Optional)
Priority>The urgency of the task. (Optional)
Category>A short tag such as @home, @work, @inet. (Optional)
Deadline>The latest date the task should be done. (Optional)
Scheduled date>The planned date to do the task. (Optional)
Subtasks>Every task can have any number of subtasks. (Optional)
.TE

Tasks can be ordered by any of those fields, and categories can be used to show
only some certain kinds of tasks. Tudu also warns when a deadline is
approaching, and shows the percentage of the task done so far.

.SS theme
Window positions are described by rows; each row with the syntax:
.RS
row = [height]([width|]window[, [width|]window, ...])
.RE
The height and width can be the number of characters or a percentage followed by
\fB%\fR. The possible windows are: help, tree, info, blank, vpipe, hpipe text, 
and schedule. The windows help, vpipe and info don't need to have height, neither 
hpipe needs to have width, because is predefined as 1.
TuDu will try to guess the non given information.

Other options for the theme are:
.IP "columns = colm1,...,colmN"
Columns in tree window. The possible columns are: title, priority, category and
deadline.
.IP "category_length = numChar"
Number of characters to be displayed of the category.
.IP "color = color_text, color_background"
The default colors for the text and background. If your terminal has support to 
change colora the colors can be defined  as \fB(r, g, b)\fR, where r, g and b are
numbers from 0 to 1000, or with the words: black, red, green, yellow, blue, 
magenta, cyan, white, transparent.
.IP "window = color_text, color_background"
